# pytorch-tut

It consists of many basic Machine Learning in general and also Deep Learning projects, that I encountered while doing the literature study on it. Currently, it has MNIST handwritten digit classifier and shall be updated as the time progresses.

As the repository name suggests, all the codes are written using python3 and the DL aspect is done using pytorch (version 1.4.0)
